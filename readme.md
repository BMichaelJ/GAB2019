# Cognitive Services Lab

*Modified from orignial repo - https://github.com/benc-uk/serverless-cosmos-lab

This is a hands on lab guide for Azure. In this lab you will deploy a serverless application which uses Azure Cognitive Services to analyze photos gathered from twitter. An Azure Logic App drives the process and carries out most of the tasks. 

The Logic App flow is:
- Calls the Twitter API and searches for tweets containing a certain hashtag
- Calls the Azure cognitive service API for each photo and gets the result which is a description of the contents of the photo
- Stores the result in Azure Cosmos DB

The Azure cognitive service uses a pre-trained computer vision model to return results describing the image as a JSON object. Cosmos DB is a No-SQL database, which the Logic App uses to store the results as JSON documents, one for each photo result.

The final part of the application is a simple web app, written in Node.js. This web app is hosted in Azure as an Web App Service, it connects to Cosmos DB and displays the photo analysis results as a simple web page.

The guide steps through deploying and configuring the complete end to end solution in Azure

# Solution Architecture

# High Level Steps
1. Create a new resource group
2. Create a Computer Vision API account
3. Create a new Cosmos DB account
4. Create a database and collection in Cosmos DB
5. Create a Logic App
6. Connect Logic App to Twitter
7. Connect Logic App to Cosmos DB 
8. Test and verify
9. Create a new Web App
10. Connect Web App to Cosmos DB
11. View results :)

**************
1.	Create a resource group for all your resources. 
2.	In your resource group add a Computer Vision API. 
3.	Provide the CV a name, location, free pricing tier and the resource group we created prior. 
4.	Click Create. 

In the computer vision resource, we need to copy some information to a notepad as we will need them later. 
1.	Go to the CV resource
2.	In the overview copy the endpoint to a notepad
3.	In the Keys menu, copy the key to the notepad

In our resource group we will add a cosmosDB
1.	Select the resource group 
2.	Give the cosmosdb a global unique name
3.	The API we use in this lab is Core (SQL)
4.	Set the Location
5.	Georedundancy and multi region is not necessary in this lab
6.	Click create

Time for a coffee while deployment is running. When the CosmosDB is deployed we need to copy some information again. 
1.	Copy the URI and the keys to the notepad 
2.	In the data explorer, create a database and collection, in the code I used “mydb” and “photos”
3.	Set the partition key to /user
4.	Keep the RU to 400

Our logic app is the trigger of the application. We need it to trigger when a certain tweet is happening such as a hashtag #AzureSkane

1.	Create a logic app, give it a name, add the resource group and location
2.	In the logic app it will open the Logic App Designer
3.	Locate and choose “When a tweet is happening”
4.	Sign in with a twitter account (I created a new test twitter)
5.	Add the Hashtag you want it to react to and set the interval
6.	Click next step and choose the Computer Vision API
7.	Select “Describe Image URL” add a parameter of “Image URL”
8.	Add a twitter parameter named “Media Urls” (this will generate a for each loop)
9.	Choose an action (important that the next step stays in the loop)
10.	Add a CosmosDB action
11.	Select Create or Update document
12.	Give the connection a name (not important what you choose)
13.	Select the resource group of your cosmosDB
14.	Add the database we created (mydb)
15.	Add the collection (photos)
16.	In the document copy the text of the picture. Remember to use all the “” and comma. The guid() is located in dynamic content under expressions. Note that description content do not contain “ “

{
"description": description,
"id": "@{guid()}",
"time": "@{utcNow()}",
"url": "@{items('For_each')}",
"user": "@{triggerBody()?['UserDetails']?['FullName']}"
},

![Logicappdetails](logicappdetails.PNG)

Guid is a random generated ID, Description contains a caption and tags from the picture, UTCnow is our timestamp, url of the picture and the user that posted it.

17.	Add a parameter Partition key
18.	add Twitter name to it as seen on the picture (important it is in “ ”)
 "Name"
 ![partitionskeydetails](PartitionKeysDetails.PNG)

19.	Click save
20.	Click Run

Go to twitter and create a post with the hashtag you added and add a picture you want described.
Return to the logic app and wait for the result. The logic app should succeed. You can see the description of the picture. In the CosmosDB under data explorer the data from our tweet will be located. 

#WebApp

We want to show our results in a neat way than the CosmosDB information. 
1.	Create a Web App resource to our resource group
2.	Give it a global unique name, choose windows and code
3.	Create a app service plan
a.	Click on the App service plan
b.	Click create new
c.	Give it a name and choose the location used in your Resource Group
d.	Select pricing tier
e.	In the top choose Dev / Test
f.	Select the F1 plan and click apply
4.	Create the web app and wait for deployment.
5.	In the Web app locate the configuration menu.
6.	Add the following table to application settings (the name must be in capital to fit the code)


Name	                     Value
DB_NAME	                  mydb
DB_COLLECTION	            photos
DB_ENDPOINT	              CosmosDB URI
DB_KEY	                   CosmosDB Key
PROJECT	                  webapp


Time to add the web app code to our website. The code is in a Github repository located here: https://github.com/BMichaelJ/GAB2019.git If you want to change the database name in the code you can fork it and change it in the index.js 

1.	Go to the web app in azure
2.	Choose the deployment center 
3.	Choose “External” source control
4.	Choose Kudu engine
5.	From the repository from git (https://github.com/BMichaelJ/GAB2019.git) 
6.	Use the master branch by entering “master”
7.	Set type to Git
8.	Click create
9.	When the deployment center is synced 
10.	Go to the overview tab and click on the URL
